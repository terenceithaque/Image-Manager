    <h1>What does Image Manager ?</h1>
    <p>
      Image Manager is used to store images from your hard drive online.
      Imagine: you are a web developer for example. For your websites, you need
      need images to accompany the texts. A hard disk can quickly be be broken
      or lost. You would probably not like to have to find the images one by
      one, especially images one by one, especially since not everyone has an
      SSD to store their projects or images safely. This is where Image Manager
      comes into play: you import images from your hard drive to the to the
      website, and you can retrieve them later by logging in with one of your
      with one of your users.
