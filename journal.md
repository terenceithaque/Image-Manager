Hello guys, I practice software programming from one year ago, and I tried languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. The language I know the best is Python. But I started a new client-side github website project, a site where visitors getting a username would be able to store images coming from their hard drive on it, using "<input type = "file">". I don't know very well the client-side Web languages, so I was wondering some questions to myself :

- Is javascript able to store images using localStorage.setItem ?

- I would like that users could create multiple usernames to store different images. Creating a new username would create a folder which would be named as the username. This folder will contain images that user selected from his file system (for example, my computer runs Windows 10, so it is the File Explorer for me). Can we create a such folder with javascript ?

Users would be able to do this things :

- Download images he/she have stored on my website

- Search an image with a search bar using its name and his file extension.

- Know that softwares I'm using to do this project are Microsoft VS Code, Git (live-server) and Mozilla Firefox, to test my website.

Thank you to answer to my questions !
